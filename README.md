# Olympics-Analyzer---A-Data-Analysis-Project

📊 A Data Analysis & Machine Learning Project
The Olympic Data Analyser is a comprehensive tool designed to analyze historical Olympic data, providing deep insights into athlete and country performances. It also includes predictive analytics for future medalists and an "Ideal Athlete Profile" feature.


🚀 Features
✅ Overall & Sport-wise Analysis – Breakdown of athlete performance across different sports.
✅ Country-wise Performance Breakdown – Insights into country performances over the years.
✅ Gold Medal Prediction – Predicts potential gold medal winners using Machine Learning.
✅ Ideal Athlete Profile – Identifies the optimal physical characteristics of athletes in different sports.


🏗️ Methodology
📌 Data Collection
Utilized a dataset covering Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016, including athlete attributes like age, height, weight, and nationality.
🛠 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values (e.g., imputing height and weight).
Filtered data based on sport, country, and sex for specific analyses.
🔍 Modeling Techniques
Gold Medal Prediction:
Implemented Random Forest and Logistic Regression to predict gold medalists.
Evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score.
Ideal Athlete Profiling:
Used K-Means Clustering to determine ideal athlete characteristics per sport.

📈 Results
🥇 Gold Medal Prediction
✔ The Random Forest model achieved 95% accuracy in predicting gold medalists.
✔ Athlete characteristics like age, height, and past medal history are key predictors.

🎯 Ideal Athlete Profile
✔ The model identified optimal height, weight, and age range for athletes in each sport.
