# Olympic Data Analyser

## 📊 Overview

The **Olympic Data Analyser** is a comprehensive tool designed for analyzing historical Olympic data. It provides deep insights into athlete and country performances while incorporating predictive analytics to forecast future medalists and determine the "Ideal Athlete Profile."

## 🚀 Features

- **Overall & Sport-wise Analysis**: Breakdown of athlete performance across different sports.
- **Country-wise Performance Breakdown**: Insights into country performances over the years.
- **Gold Medal Prediction**: Machine Learning-based prediction of potential gold medal winners.
- **Ideal Athlete Profile**: Identification of optimal physical characteristics for athletes in different sports.

## 🏗️ Methodology

### 📌 Data Collection

- Utilized a dataset covering Olympic Games from **1896 to 2016**, including attributes such as **age, height, weight, nationality, and sport**.

### 🛠 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values (e.g., imputing height and weight).
- Filtered data based on **sport, country, and gender** for specific analyses.

### 🔍 Modeling Techniques

#### Gold Medal Prediction

- Implemented **Random Forest** and **Logistic Regression** models to predict gold medalists.
